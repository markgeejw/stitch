_Why another low-code webapp builder?_ 

Stitch emphasizes on being FAST! It uses the latest tech stack like [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to minimize the overhead for building general components. 

Stitch is in _early-development_ and was intended to be built for machine learning applications, to quickly showcase inference results in an effective but simple way. To support this, Stitch provides components for performing inference with common ML tasks like computer vision, speech recognition.
